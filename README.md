With the analysis presented, we want to understand if the popularity and the number of plays of an artist on Spotify are related to the popularity of the same on social networks (in this analysis, we will consider Instagram as an example of a social network).
We try to develop an architecture able to acquiring and processing a large amount of data from different sources, Spotify and Instagram.
It will be used as a DBMS to store MySQL data. The reasons for this choice are many: its tabular form, the guarantee of availability and availability of data (consistency and availability in the CAP theorem), the ACID properties of the relational model.
Finally, the qualitative analysis of the data was performed taking into consideration the dimensions of reliability and correctness.
